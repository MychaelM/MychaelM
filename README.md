### Here is what I am working on! ðŸ‘‹

I am a QA Engineer at MX Technologies inc. I have a Bachelors of Science in Information Technology but I transitioned to web development field once I realized my passion for technology was better suited there. I am currently learning Ruby on Rails but I also love building using React and Node.
